        "\n",
        "This challenge is based on the **Permuted MNIST** dataset, which represents a typical **fast-adaptation meta-learning** scenario.  \n",
        "Unlike the traditional MNIST handwritten digit classification task, Permuted MNIST introduces two types of random permutations for each task:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1️⃣ Pixel Permutation\n",
        "The 784 pixels of each input image are randomly shuffled, destroying the original spatial structure. Different tasks use different permutation patterns, so the model cannot rely on convolutional spatial priors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2️⃣ Label Permutation\n",
        "The digit labels in each task are remapped (for example, all “3”s become “7”s, and all “7”s become “1”s). This means the model must “relearn from scratch” the class-to-label correspondence in every new task.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ⚙️ System Constraints\n",
        "- 💻 **Computation**: CPU only (2 cores), 4GB memory.  \n",
        "- ⏱ **Time constraint**: The total training and inference time per task must be kept within **1 minute**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hence, the core goal of this challenge is:  \n",
        "> **To design a learning algorithm capable of fast convergence and stable generalization under extremely limited computational resources.**\n"

        "## Ⅱ Methodology\n",
        "\n",
        "To tackle the dual challenges of **pixel permutation** and **label permutation** in the Permuted MNIST task, this project follows a systematic, **“simple-to-advanced, step-by-step optimization”** strategy.  \n",
        "The process ultimately results in a balanced and efficient model: the **TorchMLP Agent**.  \n",
        "Below is a record of the model’s evolution from the baseline to the final optimized version.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1️⃣ Baseline Exploration\n",
        "\n",
        "#### (1) Random and Linear Models\n",
        "- **Random Predictor**: Used as a zero baseline to verify the environment interface and evaluation pipeline.  \n",
        "- **Linear Classifier**: A single-layer softmax regression model with L2 regularization.  \n",
        "  - Performs decently under a fixed permutation (~70%) but generalizes poorly across tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### (2) Initial MLP Design\n",
        "- **TorchMLP**: Two fully connected layers `100 → 100 → 10` with ReLU activation.  \n",
        "  - Training parameters: `epochs=3, batch_size=128`.  \n",
        "  - This serves as the starting point for later improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering (FE)\n",
        "\n",
        "To reduce brightness and amplitude variations between different permutation tasks and improve robustness, the following lightweight preprocessing is applied:  \n",
        "- **Pixel Normalization**: If input range is `[0,255]`, rescale to `[0,1]`.  \n",
        "- **Per-sample L2 Normalization**: Each sample is normalized by its L2 norm to mitigate intensity variation (acts like brightness adjustment).  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3️⃣ Improvement of the Model Structure (IMS)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### (1) Expanded Hidden Dimensions\n",
        "- The early structure `100→100` is expanded to `256→128` to enhance nonlinear representation capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### (2) BatchNorm + Activation Enhancement\n",
        "- Add **Batch Normalization** after each linear layer to stabilize training.  \n",
        "- Activation combination: use **SiLU** in the first layer (smooth gradients, faster convergence) and **ReLU** in the second (better sparsity).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### (3) Residual Bottleneck Block\n",
        "- Introduce a lightweight residual block within the 256-dimensional layer: `256 → 64 → 256`.  \n",
        "- Structure: `BN → SiLU → Linear → BN → SiLU → Linear`, followed by a pre-activation residual connection `x + h`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### (4) Regularization on the Classification Head\n",
        "- Apply **Weight Normalization** to the final layer `Linear(128→10)` to reduce scale instability.  \n",
        "- Disable it before quantization for compatibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "> In addition, **Label Smoothing (ε=0.05)** is introduced to prevent overconfidence on single labels and improve generalization across label-permuted tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4️⃣ Optimizer (OP)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Comparison and Selection\n",
        "- Compared **Adam**, **SGD**, and **RMSprop**:\n",
        "  - Adam: fast convergence but unstable oscillations;  \n",
        "  - SGD: stable but slow;  \n",
        "  - ✅ **RMSprop**: balanced speed and smoothness on CPU — selected as the final optimizer. Adding a **Cosine Annealing scheduler** further smooths the loss curve and stabilizes validation accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5️⃣ Model Compression (MC)\n",
        "\n",
        "To further improve inference speed and efficiency under CPU constraints, two lightweight compression techniques were tested:  \n",
        "- **Dynamic INT8 Quantization**: Apply dynamic quantization to all linear layers, achieving significant acceleration with negligible accuracy loss.  \n",
        "- **Prune40% + INT8**: Perform 40% pruning before quantization — faster inference but with slight accuracy degradation.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The final deployment uses **Dynamic INT8 Quantization**, which preserves stable accuracy while greatly accelerating inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning and Final Configuration\n",
        "\n",
        "A grid search was conducted over:  \n",
        "`epochs ∈ {5, 7, 10, 15}`, `batch_size ∈ {100, 128}`  \n",
        "\n",
        "Final choice:  \n",
        "> **epochs = 10**, **batch_size = 128**\n",
        "\n",
        "This configuration achieves over **98.5% accuracy**  \n",
        "while keeping total runtime per task within **35–38 seconds (CPU mode)**.\n"

        "The final model completed all tasks in about **21 seconds**, leaving nearly 40 seconds unused out of the 60-second evaluation limit.  \n",
        "This indicates that the computational budget was not fully exploited — more training epochs, structural depth, or small-scale ensembles could be implemented to extract higher accuracy within the allowed runtime.\n",

        "**2️⃣ Excessive CPU Usage**  \n",
        "During multi-task evaluation, CPU utilization occasionally exceeded 140% (equivalent to two cores running at full load with slight oversubscription), suggesting suboptimal thread management and data loading. Possible improvements include:  \n",
        "- Reducing the number of `DataLoader` workers (`num_workers=0` or `1`) to minimize parallel overhead;  \n",
        "- Adjusting the `batch_size` to balance compute and memory bandwidth;  \n",
        "- Using `torch.set_num_threads(1)` before and after quantization to stabilize CPU usage.\n",

        "**1️⃣ Increase Epochs + Early Stopping Mechanism**  \n",
        "Since the model did not reach the time limit at 20 epochs, the training duration can be safely extended to **30 epochs or more**, combined with early stopping (e.g., `patience=3–5`) to prevent overfitting.  \n",
        "This would allow more thorough convergence without wasting resources, leading to smoother validation curves and more stable accuracy.\n",

        "**2️⃣ Dropout Regularization**  \n",
        "Introducing moderate **Dropout (p≈0.1–0.2)** in the bottleneck or hidden layers can prevent neuron co-adaptation and improve robustness against noise and permutation variations.  \n",
        "In a CPU-only setting, this lightweight regularization adds almost no computational cost while noticeably enhancing generalization and stability.\n",

        "Training multiple lightweight models (using different random seeds or subsets of data) within the available time and averaging their predictions during inference can improve generalization.  \n",
        "Even under CPU constraints, such ensembling can provide meaningful gains by reducing variance and smoothing out random errors at low additional cost.\n",
